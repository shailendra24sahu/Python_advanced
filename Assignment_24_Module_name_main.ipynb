In this case, we could use multiple import statements with different settings to ensure that the module is imported correctly in both versions.\n",

    "Circular importing occurs when two or more modules import each other, which can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't immediately visible or easy to diagnose. To avoid circular importing, we can use the following techniques:\n",

    "1. Restructure our code: One way to avoid circular importing is to restructure our code so that the modules don't need to import each other. This may involve moving common functionality into a separate module or breaking up large modules into smaller, more focused ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use lazy imports: Another approach to avoiding circular importing is to use lazy imports, where we import a module only when we need it, rather than at the top of our code. This can help reduce the risk of circular dependencies and can also improve the performance of our program by only loading modules as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Refactor our code: we can also refactor our code to remove the circular dependency. One way to do this is to move the code that depends on the other module into a function or method and call that function or method after both modules have been imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a third module: If we have two modules that need to import each other, we can create a third module that imports both of them and provides a common interface that they can both use. This can help to break the circular dependency and make our code more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use dependency injection: Another technique to avoid circular importing is to use dependency injection, where we pass the required module as a parameter to the function or method that needs it, rather than importing it directly. This can help to reduce coupling between modules and make our code more flexible and testable.\n",

    "\n",

    "Referring to the `__name__` attribute or the string `'__main__'` is particularly useful in Python when you want to create scripts that can be used both as standalone programs and as modules to be imported into other scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__name__` Attribute:\n",
    "   In Python, every module (a Python file) has a built-in attribute called `__name__`. When the Python interpreter runs a script, it sets the value of `__name__` based on how the script is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the script is being run as the main program (standalone), the `__name__` attribute is set to `'__main__'`.\n",
    "   - If the script is being imported as a module into another script, the `__name__` attribute is set to the name of the module (i.e., the filename without the '.py' extension).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `'__main__'` String:\n",
    "   The string `'__main__'` is a special name in Python, used to indicate the main entry point of a program. When a Python script is executed as the main program (directly from the command line or by clicking \"Run\" in an IDE), it is associated with the name `'__main__'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use of `__name__` and `'__main__'` is to control the execution of code within a script. By using the `if __name__ == '__main__':` construct, you can define blocks of code that will only be executed when the script is run as the main program, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example script: my_script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_function():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from some_function!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    # This block of code will only be executed when my_script.py is run directly.\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from the main program!\")\n",
    "    some_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you run `my_script.py` from the command line, you will see the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello from the main program!\n",
    "Hello from some_function!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you import `my_script.py` as a module in another script, the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block will not be executed, and only the function definitions and other code outside that block will be accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature allows you to organize your Python code efficiently and avoid unintended side effects when importing scripts as modules. It is a best practice to use `__name__` and `'__main__'` when writing reusable Python modules that may also be executed as standalone scripts."
