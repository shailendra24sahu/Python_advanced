    "3. When working with custom classes or objects, operator overloading can make code more readable and intuitive by allowing us to define how the objects interact with built-in operators and functions. For example, we can define how to compare objects using `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`, or how to print objects using `str()` or `repr()`.\n",
