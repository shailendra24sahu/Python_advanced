    "One benefit of generators is that they can produce a potentially infinite sequence of values without needing to pre-compute all of the values in memory. This means that generators are memory-efficient and can be used to produce values on-the-fly as they are needed, rather than computing all of the values up front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of generators is that they can be used to create pipelines of data processing functions, where each function takes an input from a generator, processes it, and produces an output for the next function in the pipeline. This allows for a more modular and flexible approach to data processing, where each step in the pipeline can be customized or swapped out as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators can also be used to simplify code and improve performance in situations where a large amount of data needs to be processed sequentially, but it is not practical to pre-compute all of the data in memory at once. By using generators to process the data in chunks or on-the-fly, the overall memory usage and processing time can be reduced, leading to faster and more efficient code."
