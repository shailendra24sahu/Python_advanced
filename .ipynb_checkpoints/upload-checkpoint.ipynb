    "Exception processing is an important feature of Python that allows for handling of errors and exceptions that can occur during program execution. Here are three applications of exception processing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error handling: When a program encounters an error, such as a division by zero or a file that cannot be found, it raises an exception. By using exception handling, the program can catch and handle these exceptions in a way that provides feedback to the user or takes corrective action. For example, a program that reads data from a file can catch exceptions when the file is not found or when there is an error reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = x / y\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: division by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource management: In some cases, a program may need to acquire resources, such as file handles or network connections, and ensure that they are properly released when they are no longer needed. By using exception handling, the program can ensure that resources are properly released, even if an error occurs. For example, a program that opens a network connection can catch exceptions when the connection is lost or when there is an error sending or receiving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    conn = open_connection()\n",
    "    data = conn.recv()\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Program flow control: In some cases, a program may need to change its flow based on certain conditions or events. By using exception handling, the program can change its flow based on the occurrence of an exception. For example, a program that searches for a value in a list can catch exceptions when the value is not found and perform a different action based on whether the value is found or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    index = mylist.index(value)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Value not found\")\n",

    "When an exception is raised during the execution of a script, there are several options available for recovering from the exception and allowing the program to continue running. Here are some common techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try-except` block: We can use a `try-except` block to catch and handle the exception. This allows us to execute alternative code if an exception is raised. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception and recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `try-finally` block: We can use a `try-finally` block to ensure that certain code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised. This is useful for releasing resources or closing files. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that should always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `else` clause: We can use an `else` clause with a `try-except` block to execute code only if no exceptions are raised. This can be useful for executing code that should only be run if the main code block executes successfully. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exceptions are raised\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `raise` statement: We can use the `raise` statement to raise our own exceptions in response to certain conditions. This can be useful for signaling errors or other exceptional conditions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\")\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, if `x` is less than 0, a `ValueError` exception is raised with the message \"x must be non-negative\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Built-in functions: Many built-in functions in Python can raise exceptions if they encounter an error condition. For example, the `open()` function can raise a `FileNotFoundError` if it cannot find the specified file, and the `int()` function can raise a `ValueError` if the provided argument cannot be converted to an integer. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If no exact match is found, the interpreter looks for a handler that matches a superclass of the raised exception. This allows us to catch a broader range of exceptions with a single handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If no matching handler is found at all, the exception propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top level of the program, where it is either handled by a default exception handler or causes the program to terminate with an error message.\n",

    "1. Using the `with_traceback()` method: This method allows to attach a traceback to an exception object. The `traceback` argument should be a traceback object or `None`. If it is `None`, the traceback is extracted from the current stack frame. Here's an example:\n",
