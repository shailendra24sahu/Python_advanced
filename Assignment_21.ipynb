    "When we say that the values in a probability distribution are random, it means that there is inherent uncertainty associated with them. However, this randomness is not absolute, but rather governed by a set of probabilistic rules. A probability distribution captures the range of possible values and assigns probabilities to each value based on certain assumptions or observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While individual outcomes may be unpredictable, the overall behavior of a probability distribution can be understood and characterized. Probability theory allows us to make predictions about the likelihood of specific outcomes or the behavior of a system as a whole, even in the presence of randomness. By studying the properties of a probability distribution and applying mathematical and statistical techniques, we can make informed predictions and draw conclusions about the likelihood of different events occurring.\n",

    "In practice, probability distributions are often derived from empirical data or modeled based on theoretical assumptions. For example, the normal distribution (bell curve) is frequently used to model continuous random variables in many natural and social phenomena. By fitting data to a particular probability distribution, we can estimate parameters and make predictions about future events or draw inferences about the underlying processes generating the data.\n",

These algorithms use a starting point called a seed and apply mathematical operations to produce a sequence of numbers that appear random.

Additionally, they aim to exhibit statistical properties similar to true random numbers, such as uniform distribution, independence, and lack of discernible patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many applications, pseudo-random numbers are \"good enough\" because they provide a sufficiently random-like behavior and satisfy statistical requirements.

Conversely, a larger standard deviation indicates greater variability, leading to a wider distribution.\n",

The distribution would have a bell-shaped curve, with the peak at the mean height and probabilities decreasing as heights deviate from the mean in either direction.\n",

In the short term, the distribution may appear more variable, with individual samples showing greater deviations from the mean. However, as the number of samples or observations increases, the distribution becomes more symmetrical, bell-shaped, and centered around the mean. This is described by the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying distribution.\n",
