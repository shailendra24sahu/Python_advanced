    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior of existing classes or modules at runtime. It allows you to add, replace, or modify methods, attributes, or functions in existing code without having to modify the original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key points about monkey patching:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic Modification: Monkey patching enables you to modify the behavior of a class or module during runtime, without altering the original source code. This can be useful when you want to extend or enhance the functionality of existing code without having to directly modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Patching Classes: Monkey patching can involve adding new methods or attributes to an existing class, overriding existing methods, or even replacing entire classes with new implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Patching Modules: Monkey patching can also be applied to modules, allowing you to add, replace, or modify functions, constants, or variables within a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Caution and Best Practices: While monkey patching can be a powerful technique, it should be used with caution. Modifying code at runtime can make it harder to understand and maintain, and it may introduce unexpected behavior or compatibility issues. It's generally recommended to use monkey patching sparingly and only when necessary, clearly documenting any modifications made.\n",

    "   - A shallow copy creates a new object or data structure, but the elements of the new copy still reference the same objects as the original.\n",

    "   - A deep copy creates a new object or data structure and recursively copies all the objects found within the original.\n",
    "   - It means that both the container and the objects contained within it are entirely independent of the original.\n",
    "   - Changes made to the original objects will not affect the deep copy, and vice versa.\n",
    "   - Deep copy is typically done using the `deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module.\n"
